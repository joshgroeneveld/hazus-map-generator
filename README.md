# hazus-map-generator

## Purpose

When finished, this tool will create a simple GUI (using wxPython) to generate
a number of maps based on a HAZUS analysis.  The tool assumes that you already
have a HAZUS study region and that you have completed a HAZUS run.

### Intent

I generally create the same or similar sets of maps for each HAZUS study region.
This script should save time using template maps and data layers.

### Status

This is a work in progress.  For now, you can choose an output directory, but it's not wired up to do anything.
I'll update this as the project moves along.

For now, I'm developing this using:
HAZUS: 2.1
ArcGIS 10.2.2
